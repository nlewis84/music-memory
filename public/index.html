      This app was designed to work best on chromebook, 
      laptop, or desktop. The app is not optimized for 
      mobile devices and you will need to tap to play 
      every song, every time you play the game. There
      is a bar blocking the name of the youtube video,
      but you can still see the part of the cover image
      for the video.

      For best results, use a laptop or desktop computer.
